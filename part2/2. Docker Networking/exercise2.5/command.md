# Part 1

## Exercise 2.5
---
A project over at https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise has a hardly working application. Go ahead and clone it for yourself. The project already includes docker-compose.yml so you can start it by running docker-compose up.

``` powershell
    docker-compose up -d --scale compute=5
```
